/**
 * This selector selects files against a mapped set of target files, selecting
 * all those files which are different.
 * Files with different lengths are deemed different
 * automatically
 * Files with identical timestamps are viewed as matching by
 * default, unless you specify otherwise.
 * Contents are compared if the lengths are the same
 * and the timestamps are ignored or the same,
 * except if you decide to ignore contents to gain speed.
 * <p>
 * This is a useful selector to work with programs and tasks that don't handle
 * dependency checking properly; Even if a predecessor task always creates its
 * output files, followup tasks can be driven off copies made with a different
 * selector, so their dependencies are driven on the absolute state of the
 * files, not a timestamp.
 * <p>
 * Clearly, however, bulk file comparisons is inefficient; anything that can
 * use timestamps is to be preferred. If this selector must be used, use it
 * over as few files as possible, perhaps following it with an &lt;uptodate;&gt
 * to keep the descendant routines conditional.
